        <h1>Marketer, (future) web designer and passionate traveller</h1>
        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <p>My name is Lorena Tapia. I started my career in digital marketing but always had interest in design. Never in my comfort zone, I decided to give more time into this passion and combine it with my learnings in digital to become a web designer.</p>
        <p>Currently Iâ€™m based in Barcelona, where I combine my work as CRM project coordinator with my studies in web design.</p>
